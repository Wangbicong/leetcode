# Solution 1: Solve the challenge: 
# "Can you solve it without using extra space?"
# 
# Hint: 
# 1. like 102 Linked List Cycle, you can figure out if there is a cycle
# 2. if there is a cycle, move slow point to head, and move both points at the same speed until they meet
#
# Figure:
#   (1)- * - * - * -(2)- * - #
#                    |       |
#                    * - * - *
#
# Assume that they first meet at '#â€˜, you can prove that 
#        distance(1 -> 2) = distance(# -> 2) + n * length of cycle  (n = 0, 1, 2, ...)
# So if moving distance(1 -> 2) steps, you can return to the origin of the cycle
